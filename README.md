## McKenzie Steenson Welcomes You

As the great Michael Scott once said:

> Guess what, I have flows. What are they? Oh I don't know.
> I sing in the shower.
> Sometimes I spend too much time volunteering
> Occoasionally I'll hit somebody with my car.
> So sue me."

He also said:

> Would I rather be feared or loved?
> Easy.
> Both.
> I want people to be afraid of how much they love me.
